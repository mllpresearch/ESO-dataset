abstract = {The application of large language models (LLMs) to speech translation (ST), or in general, to machine translation (MT), has recently provided excellent results superseding conventional encoder-decoder MT systems in the general domain. However, this is not clearly the case when LLMs as MT systems are translating medical-related materials. In this respect, the provision of multilingual training materials for oncology professionals is a goal of the EU project Interact-Europe in which this work was framed. To this end, cross-language technology adapted to the oncology domain was developed, evaluated and deployed for multilingual interspeciality medical education. More precisely, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and MT models were adapted to the oncology domain to translate English pre-recorded training videos, kindly provided by the European School of Oncology (ESO), into French, Spanish, German and Slovene. In this work, three categories of MT models adapted to the medical domain were assessed: bilingual encoder-decoder MT models trained from scratch, pre-trained large multilingual encoder-decoder MT models and multilingual decoder-only LLMs. The experimental results underline the competitiveness in translation quality of LLMs compared to encoder-decoder MT models. Finally, the ESO speech dataset, comprising roughly 1,000 videos and 745 hours for the training and evaluation of ASR and MT models, was publicly released for the scientific community.},

CORPUS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
-----------------------------

Total size: 48 GiB (uncompressed)

The data is organized in 3 main directories: "train" (training data), "dev"
(validation data) and "test" (evaluation data).
Both "dev" and "test" directories contain one subdirectory for each sample
and a list containing the IDs of the samples of the set. Each sample directory contains
the audio file, the slides and two subdirectories: the first one contains the transcription
data, with the transcription in plain-text format, the aligned transcription in srt format,
and the aligned transcription in srt format but sentence-segmented. On the other hand, the
manual_translation subdirectory contains a folder for each target language (de, es, fr, sl;
according to ISO 639-1 standard), in which we can find the original manual translation,
the source and target language files temporally aligned, and the file with the timestamps
for that language pair.
The "train" directory contains one subdirectory for each sample and one list
for each subset of data as follows:
* train_audios.lst: contains the IDs of the training samples.
* train_slides.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with slides.
* train_trans.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with manual transcriptions.
* trains_trans+slides.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with manual transcriptions and slides.

Here we can see more completely the corpus structure, with additional
subdirectories:
